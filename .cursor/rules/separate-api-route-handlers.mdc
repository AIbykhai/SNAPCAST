# Separate API Route Handlers

Each Express endpoint must have its own file under routes/—group related routes by sub-folder, but never dump everything into index.ts.

## Path Pattern
backend/src/routes/**/*.ts

## Implementation Guidelines
- One file per endpoint or small group of closely related endpoints
- Group related routes in subfolders (e.g., auth/, users/, products/)
- Use index.ts only for route registration/aggregation, not endpoint implementations
- Follow RESTful naming conventions for route files

## Example Structure
```
backend/src/routes/
  ├── auth/
  │   ├── login.ts
  │   ├── register.ts
  │   ├── forgot-password.ts
  │   ├── index.ts  // imports and registers the above routes
  ├── users/
  │   ├── get-user.ts
  │   ├── update-user.ts
  │   ├── delete-user.ts
  │   ├── index.ts
  ├── index.ts  // imports and registers all route groups
```
