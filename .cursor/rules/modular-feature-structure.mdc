# Modular Feature Structure

Enforce modular feature-based organization: every React component, hook or style lives in its own file under its feature folder—no giant monoliths.

## Path Pattern
frontend/src/features/**/*.{ts,tsx}

## Implementation Guidelines
- Each React component should be in its own file
- Each custom hook should be in its own file
- Each style module should be in its own file
- Group related files under feature-specific folders
- Avoid large files with multiple components/hooks

## Example Structure
```
frontend/src/features/
  ├── auth/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── LoginForm.tsx
  │   │   ├── RegisterForm.tsx
  │   ├── hooks/
  │   │   ├── useAuth.ts
  │   ├── styles/
  │   │   ├── auth.module.css
  ├── dashboard/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── DashboardLayout.tsx
  │   │   ├── AnalyticsCard.tsx
