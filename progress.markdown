# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Initialize Git & Vercel Project (Completed)

### Actions Taken
1. Initialized Git repository in the project folder
2. Created comprehensive .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions for:
   - Node.js dependencies
   - Environment files
   - Build artifacts
   - System files
   - Testing artifacts
3. Created initial commit with all project documentation and configuration files
4. Verified all tests are passing

### Test Validation
- All Playwright tests passed successfully (6 tests)
- Git repository is properly initialized and configured
- Project structure is set up according to the implementation plan

### Next Steps
- Connect to Vercel for deployment
- Set up automatic deployments from main branch
- Configure preview deployments for PRs

## Step 2: Configure Environment Management (Completed)

### Actions Taken
1. Relocated Next.js Application: Moved the Next.js application code from a separate `snapcast UI` directory to `memory-bank/app/` for a unified project structure under a single Git repository.
2. Updated `package.json` (`memory-bank/`): Added `dev:app` script (`npm run dev --prefix app`) to run the Next.js dev server from the project root.
3. Installed App Dependencies: Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` within `memory-bank/app/` to install Next.js application dependencies, resolving peer dependency conflicts.
4. Created Local Environment File: Ensured `memory-bank/app/.env.local` is the designated file for local environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`). This file is gitignored via `app/.env*.local` in the main `.gitignore`.
5. Updated `.gitignore`: Adjusted paths in `memory-bank/.gitignore` (e.g., `app/.next/`, `app/out/`, `app/next-env.d.ts`) to correctly ignore Next.js specific files within the `app/` subfolder.
6. Vercel Configuration: Set up corresponding environment variables in Vercel project settings for deployed environments.

### Test Validation
- Next.js application starts successfully using `npm run dev:app` from the `memory-bank/` root directory.
- The `.env.local` file is correctly placed at `memory-bank/app/.env.local` and loaded by the Next.js app.
- Relevant Next.js files and folders within `app/` are correctly ignored by Git.
- Vercel environment variables are set, encrypted, and configured for different environments.

## Step 3: Set Up Backend with Database (Completed)

### Actions Taken
1. Installed Prisma and required dependencies:
   - @prisma/client
   - bcryptjs
   - jsonwebtoken
   - TypeScript type definitions
2. Created Prisma schema with the following models:
   - User (id, email, password_hash, timestamps)
   - BrandProfile (id, user_id, name, description, tone, target_audience, timestamps)
   - Post (id, user_id, brand_profile_id, content, platform, status, scheduled_at, timestamps)
   - ScheduledPost (id, post_id, scheduled_time, platform, status, timestamps)
3. Added performance indexes:
   - BrandProfile: Index on user_id
   - Post: Index on user_id
   - ScheduledPost: Index on scheduled_time
4. Implemented API endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/register: User registration with password hashing
   - POST /api/auth/login: User authentication with JWT token generation

### Test Validation (Completed)
- Ran `npx prisma generate` to generate Prisma Client.
- Ran `npx prisma db push` to create database tables.
- Verified tables and indexes are created with correct structure (via CLI and/or pgAdmin).
- Registration endpoint (`POST /api/auth/register`) successfully creates a new user (tested via Postman).
- Login endpoint (`POST /api/auth/login`) successfully authenticates a user and returns a JWT token (tested via Postman).
- Special character handling in `DATABASE_URL` (URL encoding) was validated during troubleshooting.
- (Note: Full rate limiting and JWT expiration tests can be enhanced in later testing cycles if needed. Basic functionality confirmed.)

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 4.
- Document any further issues or special configurations in `architecture.markdown` as they arise.

## Step 4: Implement Authentication (Completed)

### Actions Taken
1. Enhanced Lucia Auth Integration:
   - Configured Lucia Auth with Prisma adapter to handle authentication
   - Set up secure session management with cookies
   - Added proper type declarations for TypeScript integration
2. Created Authentication Endpoints:
   - Built `/api/auth/login` endpoint: Implements secure email/password authentication with session creation
   - Built `/api/auth/logout` endpoint: Properly invalidates user sessions
   - Enhanced `/api/auth/register` endpoint: Aligned with Lucia Auth requirements
3. Implemented Security Features:
   - Password hashing with bcrypt (compared during login)
   - Session-based authentication with secure cookies
   - Proper error handling with generic error messages to prevent information leakage
4. Added Authentication Middleware:
   - Updated Next.js middleware to protect routes based on session validity
   - Added public path exclusions for login, register, and API routes
   - Implemented proper session validation and redirection
5. Created Server-Side Authentication Utilities:
   - Added `getCurrentUser()` helper for server components
   - Added `requireAuth()` function for protected routes
   - Added `redirectIfAuthenticated()` function for login/register pages

### Test Validation
To test the authentication system:
1. Register a new user:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```

2. Login with the registered user:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```

3. Logout the user:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout \
     -b "auth_session=your_session_id"
   ```

4. Verify protected routes redirect to login page when not authenticated.

5. Verify database contains proper user records:
   - User record in the User table
   - Key record in the Key table with hashed password
   - Session record in the Session table after login

### Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned (Authentication)

- **Schema Evolution:**
  - Added `passwordHash` to the `User` model in Prisma schema for direct password storage.
  - Made the field optional for migration, then required after cleaning up nulls.
  - Used `npx prisma migrate dev` and `npx prisma generate` to keep the database and client in sync.
- **Prisma Migration Issues:**
  - If you see errors about required fields and existing nulls, delete or update those rows before making the field required.
  - Use `npx prisma studio --schema=app/prisma/schema.prisma` to inspect and edit data.
- **API Route Debugging:**
  - Ensure `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, and `/api/auth/logout` exist and are up to date.
  - Remove all logic referencing the legacy `Key` table for password auth.
- **Next.js 14+ Cookies API:**
  - Always `await cookies()` in API routes and server components.
  - Use `cookies().set(...)` and `cookies().delete(...)` for session management.
- **Frontend Integration:**
  - The logout button must POST to `/api/auth/logout` (not GET or link).
  - After logout, redirect to `/login`.
- **Testing:**
  - Register, log in, and log out with multiple users to confirm end-to-end flow.
  - Check the database for correct user and session records.
- **Caveats:**
  - If you change the schema, always regenerate the Prisma client and rerun migrations.
  - For production, ensure all environment variables are set and secrets are strong.

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 5: Personal Brand Profiling Endpoints
- Consider enhancing user profiles with additional fields (name, profile picture, etc.)
- Add email verification (for Phase 2)
