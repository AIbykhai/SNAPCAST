# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Initialize Git & Vercel Project (Completed)

### Actions Taken
1. Initialized Git repository in the project folder
2. Created comprehensive .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions for:
   - Node.js dependencies
   - Environment files
   - Build artifacts
   - System files
   - Testing artifacts
3. Created initial commit with all project documentation and configuration files
4. Verified all tests are passing

### Test Validation
- All Playwright tests passed successfully (6 tests)
- Git repository is properly initialized and configured
- Project structure is set up according to the implementation plan

### Next Steps
- Connect to Vercel for deployment
- Set up automatic deployments from main branch
- Configure preview deployments for PRs

## Step 2: Configure Environment Management (In Progress)

### Required Actions
1. Create .env.local file with the following variables:
   - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
   - OPENAI_API_KEY: OpenAI API key
   - JWT_SECRET: Secret for JWT token generation
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Backend API URL
   - AUTH0_DOMAIN: Auth0 domain (for Phase 2)
   - AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: Auth0 client ID (for Phase 2)

2. Set up Vercel environment variables:
   - Log into Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to project settings
   - Add all environment variables from .env.local
   - Configure environment-specific variables

### Test Validation Steps
1. Environment Variables:
   - Create .env.local file using the template
   - Fill in your actual values for each variable
   - Verify file is listed in .gitignore
   - Run `npm run dev` to check for environment variable errors

2. Vercel Configuration:
   - Log into Vercel dashboard
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check that variables are properly encrypted
   - Confirm environment-specific variables are configured

### Next Steps
- Once environment variables are validated, proceed to Step 3
- Document any issues or special configurations in architecture.markdown
